[^1]: I got express permission to use the ASCII Prami from [Sara](https://sarajoy.dev/#sara) as long as
[Adam](https://adam.omg.lol)/[Neatnik](https://neatnik.net) is okay with the Prami being used in the project, which he is,
and that the little 'sjw' sig on it isn't removed.

[^2]: I found the ASCII Prami logo though [omglolcli](https://github.com/rknightuk/omglolcli).
